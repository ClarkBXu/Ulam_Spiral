# Ulam_Spiral
Python script for finding the L1-norm (Manhattan) metric distance from the center of an Ulam Spiral (Nautilus Walk) to a given point.

## Author
Clark Xu - December 7, 2022

## Purpose
The Python script features a Nautilus Walk function. It includes two helper functions for constructing the Ulam Spiral squares and calculating Manhattan metric distance over the Ulam Spiral. It also includes 19 tests for verifying the script functionality, including 4 standard tests, 4 diagonal tests, 5 edge case tests, and 5 input error tests.

NumPy documented at: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/contents.html
